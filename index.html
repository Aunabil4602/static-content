    <p>Once upon a time, there was a cow named Daisy. She lived on a peaceful farm with her animal friends. Every morning, she loved to graze on fresh green grass. One day, she wandered too far from the farm. She found herself in a big, dark forest. Feeling scared, she started to moo loudly for help. The farmer heard her cries and came searching for her. With his lantern, he guided Daisy back to the farm safely. Daisy was happy to be home and never strayed far again. From that day on, she enjoyed her peaceful life with gratitude.</p>
