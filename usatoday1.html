      The U.S. Department of Defense plans to cut its civilian workforce by 5 to 8% as part of President Donald Trumpâ€™s promise to reduce the federal workforce.
      
      The mass layoffs will primarily impact new hires employed for less than two years, with around 5,4000 probationary employees losing their jobs as soon as next week, the department announced Friday.
